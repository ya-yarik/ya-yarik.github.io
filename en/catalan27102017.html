        <tr><td><p style="text-indent: 10%;">Catalonia is a free state from 10.27.17 and, now, is under Spanish occupation. Other than the will of the people of Catalonia, did not refute the new referendum. Catalonia was occupied as a part of Africa, India and others "belonged" to the British crown, Russia to the Tatar-Mongol yoke, Ukraine, the Baltic states to the Russian Empire and the USSR, Poland to Germany, and Europe as a whole to Hitler and Napoleon. You think the Catalonian referendum is not true? Do another one! Only Catalan people can vote. Those boobies who insist on a united Spain forget about the supremacy of the right of nations to self-determination not fulfilled by your beloved "advertising democrats". I'm not talking about dictatorial states - everything is clear there about their "autoritar democracy". But how does EU and, unfortunately, the USA differ in their position on Catalonia?</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">Spain now officially refuses to recognize the Catalans as a people. Many countries are essentially a union of peoples, Catalonia is a former region of Spain with historically self-identified people, and their own borders did not arise from nowhere. The current state of affairs shows that Spain is a colony with enslavers and enslaved peoples, because it officially considers that a small people can leave the big state only if the big state and common population of big state let him go. Slavery. Catalonia is a great nation with its rich and separate history.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">And about nonsense like “there is a Spanish constitution,” “the main thing is the sovereignty of the borders of Spain,” “there will be a chain reaction” - all this is a rotten pickle of corrupt brains, prepared and generously warmed up by imperialists and chauvinists of different countries, greedy for power. They afraid to lose empires built on the strength and lies, as well as European wheeler-dealers who are afraid it, because with the independence of Catalonia, they will have to negotiate and to conclude contracts with the new country. Do you think that Catalonia should ask Spain to amend the Constitution of Spain or to do a general Spanish referendum? And some faceless world community then will decide to recognize the country or not ...</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">I will give you an example that will destroy your miserable arguments. If you will continue your logical chain, that is not sustaining the critique, it turns out that Poland, Russia and, therefore, Russia, almost all European countries are illegal and, according to your own rotten pseudodemocratic opinions, they are not subject to recognition. Really if Russia wanted to gain independence from the Golden Horde, Europe from Hitler and Napoleon, it was necessary not to raise insurrection and not to fight, but it was necessary to ask the Khan, Hitler and Napoleon to hold general-empire referendums about secession of one of the nation in empire. So any actions of resistance of the Catalans to the Spanish authorities are in the same extent, turn are illegal, like rebellions against the khan, Hitler, etc. ....</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">And certainly Spain should not live democratically under the Constitution, adopted by the bloody dictator Franco, who kindly presented the post of supreme ruler to the father of their current king Philip.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">I will write here another untenable argument that is the independence of Catalonia depends from the will of the people of all of Spain or changes to the Spanish Constitution. I once heard criticism of the electoral system in the United States. I thought at the beginning, what a stupid thing - the people choose some types, which then will elect the president ... It turns out that they accept this order to solve the problem of small states that always were unheard. Roughly speaking, one million people live in one state, and 100 million people live in another.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;"> Thus, this second state, with direct democracy, will always impose an opinion to the first. The first small state will not can to resolve their issues in direct democracy (it would simply not be beneficially for politicians to listen to this small state - neither to the president, nor to deputies; 1 million is not a decisive force in voting). It is despite the fact that the problems in these two states are completely different - different terrain and climatic conditions, different infrastructure, level of development, features, etc. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">Because of natural reasons, people chosen in one state will “Impose” their problems to small state. Yes, therefore, with their system, the voice of 1 resident of 1 state can have much more weight than the voice of a resident in another state.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">It is the dominance and awareness of the value of each person’s voice over a faceless crowd of overwhelming, eternally wrong majority, derogating minority rights, like an envious, obsessed herd of morons kills a dissimilar or burns Giordano Bruno at the fire. The chauvinism of Spanish government, and the EU, does not want to understand it. Spain - the invaders of Catalonia and the Spanish wheeler-dealers are sure that Catalonia captured by Spain several centuries ago, should ask for freedom from the invaders! Right?</p>
