        <tr><td><p style="text-indent: 10%;">"...Not old-farters, which lost mind in their paper-life and money, but only true romantics with a lively mind, can have a yardstick, be true defenders and keepers of democracy and popular interests.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">24 October 2017 Chief of Staff of the President de Catalunya Josep Rius Alcaraz wrote me an answer with wonderful words, expressing sincere feelings to his homeland, it made me again to wish to embrace this proud, brave and strong people.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">I want my dreams in the victory of the small nations over empires in the world also come true. And even if something does not fulfill right now.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">You have told to the whole world about Catalonia, about your small state with big nation. All people in all counties in the world open books, sites in search all about "Catalonia" and its history. They «will be getting used» to one more proud people. It is already big mission.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">You spent referendum through "difficulties" – it is a Great Mission. You declared your independence - you have overcome fears and become heroes forever. Your Great People have been waiting for this event many hundreds of years.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">Bureaucrats, sultans of empires and wheeler-dealers are shocked. 27 October it is a new future national holiday and the Page in the victory of a Grand Nation. It is an example for imitation and it is a victory over the politicians treating with disdain to their peoples. Also, it is a victory over the hypocritical, deceitful and putrescent "stability" created by politicians for their own comfort.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">Your people made a precedent in the great cause of realizing of national identity!</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">I already wrote, the «sultans of empires-hypocritical colonial democracies», bureaucrats with double standards in their mind, big wheeler-dealers, all they are opposing the will of the people and they hate national feelings, history of small nations. They even call on Spain to "put things in order."</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">The EU and Spain showed disdain and contempt to the Catalans, to those who are giving their taxes to the old bureaucrats-dependants of Spain and the EU, feeding at their expense. It is stupid to measure the world only by money ... EU, UN must would to offer real platform for dialogue.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">They afraid separatism ... But ordinary people without such blurred consciousness must to understand - the empires always brought up slaves, when Greek city-states gave sages to the entire world. And millennia had shown it...</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">The situation in the last days predictably showed where truly democratic governments are representing the interests of their peoples. For example South Ossetia, Carabach Republic, Abkhazia (and a part of UK - Scotland) expressed you support and readiness to recognize your statehood.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">Union of bureaucrats and dealers (EU, US, Russia and some others) recognize the country's constitution, adopted by a spanish dictator, which is infringing the rights of small nations.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">They are saying that the highest source of law is the constitution, not the people's opinion, not the referendum, not results of it and, by fact, not international law. For crazy world, which is being created by them, any "cannibalistic code of rules" as constitution is more important. No one since 1978 has expertized the Spanish Constitution for compliance of international law and, in principle, of fundamental human rights. But nevertheless, contrary to international law, the leaders of the world community automatically recognized the constitution of the dictator Franco. Thus, according to the logic of the bureaucrats, if the constitution had a rule giving the right to roast rebels at the stake and then to eat up them, world leaders would have to recognize that legal too.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">Your firefighters, agriculturists, the parliament, ordinary employees and Carles Puigdemont forever inscribed themselves in history of your state; you are forever the heroes of your People, in spite of all the future. And who betrayed you - let God will be the judge for those weaklings.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">Unfortunately, «civilized world» is still respecting only force and it is important factor for new state to create and recruit the army or/and police.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">Take care. Keep you from afflictions including from the Spanish prison".</p>
