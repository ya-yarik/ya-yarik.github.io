        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">My congratulations to the Catalan Republic. They have been waiting for this event many hundreds of years.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">Finally, they are independent; the will of Great people has been realized. Bureaucrats, sultans of empires and wheeler-dealers are shocked. Today it is a new future national holiday and the Page in the victory of a Grand Nation. They are truly unlike others. It is an example for imitation and it is a victory over the politicians treating with disdain to their peoples. Also, it is a victory over the hypocritical, deceitful and putrescent "stability" created by politicians for their own comfort.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%;">This people made a precedent in the great cause of realizing their national identity!</p>
