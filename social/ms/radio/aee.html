				<h1>Hello guys!</h1>
				<h2>We are glad to see you on our site.</h2>
				<h3>WE ARE RADIO-STREAM-PROJECT "AURORA".
<p>WE HAVE A BIGGEST COLLECTION OF THE SONGS FROM YOUNG MUSICIANS.</p>

<p><u>ABOUT US.</u></p>

<p>We are free for all and in all things. We are glad to see new followers - new listeners and new musicians.</p>

<p><u>FOR ALL OUR FOLLOWERS!</u></p>

<p>DON’T FORGET OUR SIMPLE NICKNAMES ON THIS SITE (https://myspace.com/): “6TV”, “9TV”, ”11TV”, ”14TV”!</p>

<p>Oh our God, It's really terrible, when you are forced to listen incompatible songs altogether - from Frank Sinatra songs, Johann Sebastian Bach, to the songs of the group "a-ha" and then, the songs of "Enigma" after the songs of “Led Zeppelin”.</p>

<p>Therefore we had created new radio-streams and accounts and in a first time we've allocated your music by the 4 provisional groups-radio streams (read below).</p>

<p>This radio is a stream of your songs. When you connect to us, we can add 2 any your songs to our rotation. You can select 2 most cool songs from your creativity. You can report the information about your selection in a private message. Send it to one of the four profiles, containing a music allocated in the four provisional groups. Attention please! Send your private message to a profile (radio-stream), whither you wish to add your songs. In your private message, just write names of two these songs, which we must to add to our rotation. We have not a time to listen all songs.</p>

<p><u>Attention!</u></p>

<p>We are planning to create radio streams with the music of other styles. Just write us! We will do it! Have you a claim? Report us!</p>

<p>Always any division of music by styles is conditional and ungrateful. We will not argue up to ourselves hoarse with you about your works. For example, is your work a melody of the rock style or not. You will decide it if you want. Just define your music in any of the four groups. Because we do not want to offend you, our musicians-partners, we will be happy to hear your suggestions.</p>

<p>In addition, of course, we are glad to see any your news, photos and other on our wall.</p>

<p><u>FOR LISTENERS.</u></p>

<p>We are adding new songs constantly. Besides, we will share new wonderful photos, videos or articles with you in this stream in the future.</p>

<p>Finally and importantly, press on the orange triangle where is our profile photo at the top of the page or on the key "Start Radio" there and check it out!</p>

<p>Our station will added in your profile section "Radio" automatically. You can listen to us, not logging in our profile and from yours.</p></h3>
